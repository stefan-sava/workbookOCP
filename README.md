------- Chapter 1-3:
 
Exercise 1: Vehicle Speed Monitor
Scenario:
You are developing a simple monitoring system for vehicles. The system must:
â€¢	Continuously read the vehicle type and its current speed.
â€¢	Classify the vehicle based on its type (Car, Bus, or Bike) and determine whether it is speeding.
â€¢	Use a switch expression with pattern matching for type-based logic.
â€¢	Stop monitoring when a negative speed value is entered.
â€¢	Output a message for each input using decision statements (if, switch, and loops`).
 
Requirements:
Write a Java program that:
1.	Uses a while loop to repeatedly ask for a vehicle type and speed until the user enters a negative number for speed.
2.	Uses a switch expression that:
o	Matches on the vehicle type (String), using pattern matching where applicable.
o	Assigns a speed limit:
â€¢	Car: 100 km/h
â€¢	Bus: 80 km/h
â€¢	Bike: 60 km/h
3.	Compares the input speed to the limit using an if statement.
4.	Prints:
o	"Speed OK" if within the limit.
o	"Speeding!" if above the limit.
o	"Unknown vehicle type" if the type doesnâ€™t match any case.
5.	Terminates gracefully when speed < 0.
 
Example Input / Output:
 
Enter vehicle type (Car, Bus, Bike): Car
Enter speed: 90
Speed OK
Enter vehicle type (Car, Bus, Bike): Bike
Enter speed: 75
Speeding!
Enter vehicle type (Car, Bus, Bike): Train
Enter speed: 100
Unknown vehicle type
Enter vehicle type (Car, Bus, Bike): Car
Enter speed: -1

public class VehicleSpeedMonitor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
â€¦ }}
 
 
 


Exercise 2: Grid Scanner with Labeled Breaks
 
Scenario
given a 2D grid of chars, scan left-to-right, top-to-bottom to find the first digit ('0'..'9'). when found, stop all scanning immediately and print its position. skip (continue) any cell containing '#' (treated as a wall). if no digit is found, print "none".
 
Requirements
1.	use two nested for loops over char[][] grid.
2.	use a label on the outer loop.
3.	on '#', continue the inner loop only.
4.	on digit found, break the outer loop using the label.
5.	ensure indexes and control flow compile (watch for misplaced semicolons).
 
Input grid:
. . # .
a # b 2
. . . .
 
Output:
found digit '2' at (row=1, col=3)
 
public class GridScanner {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[][] grid = {
            {'.', '.', '#', '.'},
            {'a', '#', 'b', '2'},
            {'.', '.', '.', '.'}
        };
â€¦. }}
 






 
Exercise 3: Problem: Student Grade Evaluator

Requirements by Chapter
ðŸ”¹ Chapter 1: Program Structure
1.	project organized in a school package.
2.	entry point: public static void main(String[] args)
3.	input handled through Scanner.
4.	comments & clear method separation (calculateAverage, evaluateStudent, etc.).
 
ðŸ”¹ Chapter 2: Operators, Variables, Data Types
1.	declare variables for scores, attendance, average, and status.
2.	demonstrate:
o	arithmetic operators (+, /)
o	relational (>, <, >=)
o	logical (&&, ||)
o	ternary operator (?:) for quick decisions
3.	ensure correct data types (int, double, boolean); show type casting where needed.
4.	practice compound assignment (+=, -=) and increment/decrement.
 
ðŸ”¹ Chapter 3: Decision & Loop Control
1.	if/else to check pass/fail logic:
o	average â‰¥ 70 and attendance â‰¥ 75 â†’ Pass
o	average â‰¥ 50 and < 70 â†’ Re-exam
o	otherwise â†’ Fail
2.	pattern matching:
if (obj instanceof String name && !name.isEmpty()) { ... }
3.	use switch expression to convert numeric grade to letter:
String grade = switch((int)average/10) {
    case 10,9 -> "A";
    case 8 -> "B";
    case 7 -> "C";
    case 6 -> "D";
    default -> "F";
};
 
4.	loops:
â€¢	ask for multiple students until user types "exit" (use while(true) with break).
â€¢	or process an array of test scores using for-each.
5.	demonstrate continue (skip invalid input) and break (stop program).
 
Sample Interaction
 
Enter student name (or 'exit' to stop): Alice
Enter 3 test scores: 80 85 90
Enter attendance percentage: 92
Average: 85.0  Grade: B  â†’ PASS

Enter student name (or 'exit' to stop): Bob
Enter 3 test scores: 55 60 58
Enter attendance percentage: 65
Average: 57.7  Grade: D  â†’ RE-EXAM
Enter student name (or 'exit' to stop): exit
Program terminated.
